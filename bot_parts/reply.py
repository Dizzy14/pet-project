1️⃣ SISR (Single Image Super Resolution) is the task of increasing the resolution of a single image. 
From the input image with low resolution (Low Resolution, LR) 
it is necessary to reconstruct an image with high resolution (Super Resolution, SR), 
which will be as similar as possible to the original photo (High Resolution, HR).
2️⃣ SRGAN (Super Resolution GAN) is an approach to the SISR 
problem based on GANs (generative-adversarial networks).
Generative-adversarial networks are an algorithm built on a combination of two neural networks, 
one of which (the generator) generates samples and the other (the discriminator) 
tries to distinguish correct ("true") samples from incorrect ones.
